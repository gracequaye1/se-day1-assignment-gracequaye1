#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.  

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.


**Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering Answers**

**Question 1**
Software engineering is an organized application of engineering priciples,methods and tools to build and mantain good software system, and it importance is to help in desgin ,development and others.

**Question 2**
-Programming Languages (1950s-1970s) – Languages like Fortran (1957) and C (1972) made coding easier and more efficient.
-Software Engineering as a Discipline (1960s) – The field of software engineering was officially recognized to improve how software is developed.
-Agile Methodologies (2000s) – Agile methods like Scrum and XP introduced flexible and faster ways to build software

**Question 3**
-Design:Come up with high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
-Testing: making sure you tests often to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
-Deployment:So in the case of deployment when down with your software your bring it for the world to see like relasing them to maybe customers.

**Question 4**
Waterfall follows a step-by-step process with fixed phases (like requirements, design, and implementation), making it ideal for projects with clear requirements, such as banking systems,
while Agile is flexible and iterative, allowing continuous updates and collaboration, making it suitable for projects like mobile app development.

**Question 5**
Software Developer – Writes code and builds software solutions based on project requirements.
Quality Assurance Engineer – Tests the software to ensure it works correctly and meets quality standards.
Project Manager – Plans, organizes, and oversees the software development process to ensure timely delivery.

**Question 6**
Integrated Development Environments (**IDEs**) like **Visual Studio, Eclipse, and IntelliJ IDEA** help developers write, debug, and test code efficiently in one place.
Version Control Systems (**VCS**) like **Git and Subversion** track code changes and enable teamwork by managing different versions of a project.
Both tools improve productivity and collaboration in software development.

**Question 7**
Changing Requirements – Leads to project delays and scope creep.
 Solution: Use Agile methodologies to adapt quickly and maintain clear communication with stakeholders.
Tight Deadlines – Can cause rushed development and lower quality.
 Solution: Prioritize tasks, break work into smaller sprints, and set realistic timelines.
Technical Debt – Poor shortcuts can increase maintenance costs.
Solution: Regularly refactor code, follow best practices, and reassess project goals.

**Question 8**
Unit Testing – Tests individual components to ensure they work correctly.
Importance: Catches small errors early in development.
Integration Testing – Checks interactions between different modules.
Importance: Ensures smooth communication between software components.
System Testing – Evaluates the entire software as a whole.
Importance: Verifies overall functionality and performance.
Acceptance Testing – Tests if the software meets user requirements.
Importance: Confirms the product is ready for real-world use.

**Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering**

**Question 1**
Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting clear and specific questions or statements to get accurate and useful responses from AI models.
Importance: It ensures AI understands exactly what is needed, avoiding vague or confusing answers, and improving the quality of interactions.

**Question 2**
Vague Prompt: "Tell me about marketing."
Improved Prompt: "Explain digital marketing strategies for small businesses, including social media and SEO."
Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective
The improved prompt is clear, specific, and concise, guiding the AI to provide a focused response on digital marketing strategies rather than a broad, generic answer. 
It includes keywords like "small businesses," "social media," and "SEO" to ensure relevance.
